        INSTALLATION
        ============
        
        USING GITHUB
        ------------
        
            You can install SOAPpy and its dependencies directly from GitHub using PIP:
        
                pip install -e "git+http://github.com/pelletier/SOAPpy.git@develop#egg=SOAPpy"
        
        REQUIRED PACKAGES
        ------------------
        
            - fpconst 0.6.0 or later,
              <http://research.warnes.net/projects/rzope/fpconst/>
            - wstools
        
        
        OPTIONAL PACKAGES
        -----------------
        
            - pyGlobus, optional support for Globus,
              <http://www-itg.lbl.gov/gtg/projects/pyGlobus/>
        
            - M2Crypto.SSL, optional support for server-side SSL
              <http://sandbox.rulemaker.net/ngps/m2/>
        
            - If Python is compiled with SSL support (Python 2.3 does so by
              default), client-side use of SSL is supported
        
        INSTALLATION STEPS
        ------------------
        
            As of version 0.9.8 SOAPpy can be installed using the standard python
            package installation tools.
        
            To install:
        
              1) Unpack the distribution package:
        
                 On Windows, use your favorite zip file uncompression tool.
        
                 On Unix::
        
                     $ tar -xvzf SOAPpy-$VERSION$.tar.gz
        
                 If you have gnu tar, otherwise
                    ::
        
                     $ gzcat SOAPpy-$VERSION$.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
        
              2) Change into the source directory
                 ::
        
                         cd SOAPpy-$VERSION$
        
              3) Compile the package::
        
                        $ python setup.py build
        
              4) Install the package
        
                 On Windows::
        
                        $ python setup.py install
        
                 On Unix install as the owner of the python directories
                 (usally root)::
        
                        $ su root
                        Password: XXXXXX
                        $ python setup.py install
        
        
        DOCUMENTATION
        =============
        QUICK START
        -----------
        
        A simple "Hello World" http SOAP server::
        
                import SOAPpy
                def hello():
                    return "Hello World"
                server = SOAPpy.SOAPServer(("localhost", 8080))
                server.registerFunction(hello)
                server.serve_forever()
        
        And the corresponding client::
        
                import SOAPpy
                server = SOAPpy.SOAPProxy("http://localhost:8080/")
                print server.hello()

            - .cvsignore files
            
        - Make it proper packaged, specially toward setuptools.
        
        Release 0.12.0 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        This release primarily foces on bug fixes.  Primary changes:
        
        - Fixes for bug reports that have accumulated over the last year
        
            [ 916265] "Arrays of unicode do not serialize correctly (patch included)"
            [ 918216] "Parsing faults in SOAPpy 0.11.3"
            [ 925077] "SOAPpy prints out SOAP fault" (even when Config.debug is off).
            [1001646] "SOAPpy stomps headers when sending multirefs"
            [1001646] "SOAPpy stomps headers when sending multirefs.
            [1064233] "Bug fixes for complex types"
            [1064248] "Bugs in _asdict() and _asarray() in Types.py"

            [1096971] "Parse error: missing HTTP header 'Content-length'"
            [1106450] "Floats are truncated to 10 digits, causing precision loss"
            [1122991] "error from SOAPpy/Client.py for content_length evaluation?"
        
        - Fixes for 'rules' which allow control of the data types of *incoming* messages.
          As a consequence TCtest.py now passes all tests.
        
        - WSDL support has been improving, due to work on the 'wstools'
          module which is shared between ZSI and SOAPpy.
        
        - Some work has been done to improve documentation.
        
        
        Release 0.11.6 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        Changes to URLs and email addresses in documentation.
        
        
        Release 0.11.5 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        - Bug fixes
        
           - Fix string format error in fault handling
        
        
        Release 0.11.4 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        - Bug fixes
        
            - SOAPpy/Server.py: Check if header information contains SOAPAction
        	  key before checking its value.
        
            - Fixes for generating SOAP from complexType arrays, contributed by
              antonio.beamud@linkend.com
        
            - Fixed bug that caused typedArrayTypes to lose their type
              information when rendered to SOAP and added corresponding
              test case.
        
        - New Features
        
           - Enhancements to fault handling: The faultType Faultstring is now
             a non-variable string (i.e. no nsmethod in it) so that it can be
             programmatically checked.  In addition fault handlers can now be
             registered to handle specific types of faults.
        
        
           - SOAPpy/Server.py: Modified unregsiterObject function to take
             optional namespace/path args to be consistent with registerObject.
        
           - SOAPpy/Server.py: Added an unregisterObject function
        
           - Changes to allow SOAPBuilder so it can handle a 'raw' Python object.
        
        
        
        Release 0.11.2 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        - News:
        
           Ivan R. Judson has joined the SOAPpy team. He is focused on
           Globus support but is also responsible for a lot of other work for
           this release,
        
        - Bug fixes:
        
           - Code in Types.py assumes nested scopes, so I added the proper import so
             this will work under python 2.2.x
        
           - Fixing namespace collision
        
           - Fixed handing of named arguments bug introduced in 0.11.1.
        
           - Fix memory leak when exceptions are raised.
        
           - Fix bug when content-length is not present in parsed SOAP message.
        
           - Fix bug #888345: Python 2.3 boolean type serialized as int
        
           - Fix bug #875977: no escaping of bad tagnames for NoneTypes
        
        
        - New features:
        
           - Improved Globus support and documentation.  Thanks Ivan!
        
           - Added context handling
        
           - Changed the use of SOAPAction, it used to default to setting it
             to "", now it defaults to setting it to the method (not the
             nsmethod). There is a clause in Server.py that catches 'old style'
             SOAPActions (aka "") and sets them to the method. When this is
             confirmed to be what everyone wants and we decide it's alright to
             (possibly) break client/server interop, we can take the clause out
             of Server.py and just handle SOAPActions of "" as a possible
             error/warning.
        
           - Additional test code.
        
           - Raise a SOAPException instead of returning a SOAPpy.faultType
             when a SOAP Fault is encountered and simplify_objects is enabled.
        
        
        Release 0.11.1 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        - Bug fixes:
        
           - Fixed bug [ 792258 ] "SOAPBuilder.SOAPBuilder.dump can catch
             wrong exceptions" in SOAPBuilder.dump() submitted by Greg Chapman
             (glchapman).
        
           - Changes suggested by Richard Au (richardau) to fix ssl support.
             See bug report [ 752882 ] "SSL SOAP Server no longer working."
        
           - Remove call to gentag from 'dump' and add to 'dump_float', per
             bug report [ 792600 ] "SOAPBuilder.SOAPBuilder.dump possibly should
             not call gentag" by Greg Chapman (glchapman).
        
           - Add a tests for handling of nil="true" and nil="false".  This
             fixes bug [ pywebsvcs-Bugs-858168 ] 'xsi:nil="true" causes
             exception' reported by Robert Zimmermann (robertzett):
        
        - testClient1.py now works properly.  It had been failing to start the
          server thread on the second unit test.  It turned out that the
          variable 'quit' needed to be reset to zero after the SOAP server
          thread for the first unit test exited.  With the solution of this
          problem testClient1 can now be extended to run unit tests of both
          client and server components.
        
        - Added 'strict' option to the WSDL class. If strict is true, a
          RuntimeException will be raised if an unrecogned message is recieved.
          If strict is false, a warning will be printed to the console, the
          message type will be added to the WSDL schema, and processing will
          continue.  This is in response to the second half of bug report [
          817331 ] "Some WSDL.py changes", submitted by Rudolf Ruland.
        
        
        Release 0.11.0 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        - New/Changed configuration settings:
        
          - Config.simplify_objects=1 now converts all SOAPpy objects into basic
            Python types (list, dictionary, tuple, double, float, etc.).  By default,
            Config.simplify_objects=0 for backward compatibility.
        
          - Config.dict_encoding='ascii' converts the keys of dictionaries
            (e.g. created when Config.simplify_objects=1) to ascii == plain python
            strings instead of unicode strings.  This variable can be set to any
            encoding known to string.encode().
        
          - Config.strict_range=1 forces the SOAP parsing routines to perform
            range checks on recieved SOAP float and double objects.  When
            Config.strict_range=0, the default, parsing does not perform range
            checking (except for detecting overflows, which always occurs).  In
            either case, range checking is performed when
            generating SOAP float and double objects.
        
        - Fixes for WSDLProxy.
        
        - Scripts in the test/ directory
        
          - Verbose debugging messages have been turned off..
        
          - SOAPtest.py now functions when Config.simplify_objects=1
        
          - SOAPtest.py now sets Config.strict_range=1 so that range
            checks are be properly tested.
        
          - New README file listing what test scripts fail and why.
        
        - Initial support for Globus via pyGlobus contributed by Ivan
          R. Judson <judson@mcs.anl.gov>.
        
        Release 0.10.4 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        Dramatic performance improvements for large data transfers.
        
        Release 0.10.1 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        only minor changes
        
        1) Code now uses a single file to store version number
        
        2) Client and server now report 'SOAPpy' as the server/user-agent.
        
        3) All test scripts now use the local SOAPpy source instead of the
           globally installed version.
        
        Release 0.10.0 of SOAPpy
        ------------------------
        
        Enhancements:
        
        1) The new name handling mechanism has been enabled by default.
        
           The primary purpose of this release is to allow users to test this
           to see if it causes problems.  Please take the time to do so.  If
           there are no problems reported by April 15, 2003, 0.9.9 will be
           released with this feature enabled by default.
        
           Note that running a client under an old release of SOAPpy and a
           server under this release will be likely to generate errors due to
           the different name handling mechanisms.
        
        2) MS-Windows systems should now be fully supported.
        
           This required implementing a new module, ieee754, which provides
           functions for detecting and generating IEEE 754 special floating
           point values (+Inf, -Inf, NaN) which are not properly handled by
           the Windows implementation of the float() function.
        
        3) Code reorganization: The huge file SOAPpy/SOAP.py (4,122 lines,
           131K) has been split into 10 separate files. In addition code
           shared with ZSI has been moved into a separate subdirectory and a
           separate CVS module.
        
        4) Fixed bug 678239 which caused loss of namespace information in the
           client.
        
        5) Mark Bucciarelli's <mark@hubcapconsulting.com> has ported client
           support for WSDL from ZSI, as well as providing a mechanism for
           SOAPpy servers to provide WSDL on properly structured .GET
           requests.
        
        6) Added ThreadingSOAPServer which inherits from ThreadingTCPServer
           server so that multiple clients will be automatically multiplexed.
        
        
        VERSION 0.10.4
        --------------
        
        - Integrated a simple patch submitted by Erik Westra that dramatically
          improves parser performance.
        
        - WSDL tools now uses m2crypto for SSL if it's installed.
        
        - Various other WSDL changes.
        
        VERSION 0.10.3
        --------------
        
        - Removed import of obsoleted ieee753.py.  Now use the fpconst module
          proposed by PEP 754, available from
          <http://research.warnes.net/Zope/projects/fpconst/>
        
        - SOAPpy should no longer depend on pyXML.
        
        VERSION 0.10.2
        --------------
        
        - Fixed client support for basic authentication
        
        - Fixed import error in Client.py
        
        - Improved Client parsing of namespaces to support stateful SOAP servers.
        
        VERSION 0.10.1
        --------------
        
        - Modified setup.py, Server.py, and Client.py to obtain SOAPpy version
          number from a new file, version.py.
        
        - SOAP server/user-agent is now to 'SOAPpy' instead of 'SOAP.py'.
        
        - Added ident string containing CVS version to all files that were
          lacking this.
        
        VERSION 0.10.0
        --------------
        
        CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9.9-pre5
        
        - Major Change: The huge file SOAPpy/SOAP.py (4,122 lines, 131K) has
          been split into 10 separate files::
        
        	Client.py	NS.py		SOAPBuilder.py	Utilities.py
        	Config.py	Parser.py	Server.py
        	Errors.py	SOAP.py		Types.py
                
          This should ease navigation and maintenance.
        
        - A new CVS module 'wstools' was created to hold code which is used by
          both ZSI and SOAPpy.  While this module is stored separately in CVS,
          it will be distributed as an integral part of both ZSI and SOAPpy,
          and will be included as an 'internal' module by both.  In the SOAPpy
          source, it lives in the directory SOAPpy/wstools.
        
        - The files XMLname.py, ieee754.py, have been moved into SOAPpy/wstools.
        
        - Added TODO file
        
        - Fix bug in getNS that caused loss of namespace by using better
          pattern matching to find the namespace in the SOAP message.  Fixes bug
          678239
        
        - Added Mark Bucciarelli's <mark@hubcapconsulting.com> patch to
          provide wsdl code on properly structured .GET requests to the server.
        
        - Added client support for WSDL, ported from ZSI by Mark Bucciarelli
          <mark@hubcapconsulting.com>
        
        - Added ThreadingSOAPServer which inherits from ThreadingTCPServer
          server so that muliple clients will be automatically multiplexed.
        
        - Removed some files from /test for services that no longer exist.
        
        
        CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9.9-pre4
        --------------------------------
        
        - Added client support for WSDL, ported from ZSI by Mark Bucciarelli
          <mark@hubcapconsulting.com>.
        
        CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9.9-pre3
        --------------------------------
        
        - Code shared between SOAPpy and ZSI now lives in
          SOAPpy/SOAPpy/wstools and is stored in a separate CVS package.  This
          will allow ZSI and SOAPpy to keep these files synchronized.
        
        CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9.9-pre2
        --------------------------------
        
        - Fixed trivial compilation bug on Win32: Only define
          SOAPUnixSocketServer if the Unix domain sockets are supported
        
        CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9.9-pre1
        --------------------------------
        
        - Added request for nested scopes, should now work properly in python
          2.1 with named argument calls.
        
        - Fixed bug caused by omission of the ieee754 module from __init__.py.
        
        - SOAPpy now provides a SOAPUnixSocketServer class, which uses a unix
          domain socket instead of a network TCP/IP socket for communication. A
          corresponding client will be provided in the future.  [This class
          has not yet been tested.]
        
        CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9.8
        ---------------------------
        
        - IEEE 754 floating point specials (Inf, -Inf, NaN) should now be
          properly and consistently handled on all platforms.
        
          Added code to explicitly check for and handle IEEE 754 floating
          point specials (Inf, -Inf, NaN). This replaces an ugly hack for
          systems whose python float() doesn't understand the strings "Inf",
          "NaN", etc.  Floating point specials should now be properly handled
          on all operating systems.
        
          ***SOAPpy should now work properly on all versions of Microsoft Windows.***
        
          A new module, ieee754 contains the functions required to detect and
          create NaN, Inf, and -Inf values.  This module should be usable in
          other contexts.
        
        - *** The new argument handling method (via SOAPpy.SOAP.Config.specialArgs=1)
          is now enabled by default.***
        
        - Changed all references to actzero.com in SOAP.py to pywebscvs.sf.net.
        
        - Fixed a bug where lists included as parameters to SOAP method calls
          were being incorrectly named 'Results' even when another name was
          given.
        
        CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9.7
        ---------------------------
        
        - Modified structure to allow installation using Python distutils
          (i.e. setup.py).  Access to the SOAPpy library now requires:
          from SOAPpy import SOAP
        
        - I (Gregory R. Warnes) have implemented an experimental and
          non-standard method of handling named and unnamed arguments.  This
          mechanism is enabled in SOAPpy by setting
          SOAPpy.SOAP.Config.specialArgs=1.
        
          When enabled, parameters with names of the form _#### (i.e.,
          matching the regexp "^_[0-9]+") are assumed to be unnamed parameters
          and are passed to the method in numeric order.  All other parameters
          are assumed to be named and are passed using the xml tag id as the
          parameter name.  Outgoing SOAP method calls now always generate
          names in this way--whether or not specialArgs is enabled--instead of
          using the pattern v#####.
        
          See the file README.MethodParameterNaming for more details.
        
        - Added noroot parameter to the SOAPBuilder and SOAPProxy objects
          in order to provide compatibility with an older version of
          EasySOAP (v0.2) that balked if the SOAP-ENC:root parameter was
          included.(Brad Knotwell)
        
        - Added support for namespace-rewriting (used by Apache v2.x SOAP server for
          error conditions as well as stateful communication) (Christopher Blunck)
        
        - Added string <-> str conversion for array types (Python 2.2+)
          (Christopher Blunck)
        
        - Added convenience method (invoke) to SOAPProxy that calls __call (not sure
          if it is necessary - feel free to remove if you want) (Christopher Blunck)
        
        - Python 'float' are equivalent to SOAP 'double'.  Modified dump_float
          and dump_list to use SOAP type string 'double'
          appropriately. (Gregory R. Warnes)
        
        - Add basic authentication (Brad Knotwell)
        
        - Fixes to enable proper handling of SOAP faults by the client:
          - Fixed test of whether message content is text/xml when recieving a fault.
          - Added __call__ method to exception classes to match the current API.
          - The faultType.__repr__() method now print details if present
          (Gregory R. Warnes)
        
        - Added XMLnam.py which provides toXMLname() and fromXMLname() for
          properly encoding xml tag names per the SOAP 2.1 (draft)
          specification. (Gregory R. Warnes)
        
        - Added calls to toXMLname() and fromXMLname() so that tags names are
          properly encoded.  This resolves bug [ 548785 ] 'Error passing dict
          keys containing space.'  (Gregory R. Warnes)
        
        - Added code to cgi encode contents of tags when they are not a
          recognized type.  Fixes bug [ 549551 ] 'Error when passing
          non-standard types'. (Gregory R. Warnes)
        
        - Added __init__.py, so that SOAPpy can be used like a standard python
          module. (Gregory R. Warnes)
        
        
        VERSION 0.9.7 (6/27/01)
        -----------------------
        
        - Fixed the unamed ordered parameters bug
        - Added the ability to specify a http_proxy
        - Added a patch provided by Tim MiddelKoop to allow printing of proxy objects
        - Added the contrib directory and included a medusa implementation of a
          SOAP.py server by Ng Pheng Siong
        
        
        VERSION 0.9.6 (6/08/01)
        -----------------------
        
        - The date and time types now check their initial values when the type
          is created, not when the data is marshalled.
        - The date and time types are now parsed and returned as tuples (for
          multi-element types) or scalars (for single element types) in UTC and thus
          can represent the entire range of SOAP dates.
        - If an element doesn't have a type but has a name with a namespace, the
          name is tried as the type.
        - Untyped compound types with more than one element and all the elements
          the same name are turned into an array when parsing.
        - When parsing a structType, elements with the same name are placed in a
          list instead of saving just the last one. _getItemsAsList can be used to
          get an element of a structure as a list, whether there was one or many
          occurances of the item.
        - Added schemaNamespace, schemaNamespaceURI, and namespaceStyle
          configuration options. namespaceStyle takes one of 1999, 2000, or 2001,
          and sets typesNamespace, typesNamespaceURI, schemaNamespace, and
          schemaNamespaceURI.
        - Normalized the type class names, replacing Compound with compoundType,
          Struct with structType, Header with headerType, Body with bodyType, Array
          with arrayType, TypedArray with typedArrayType, Fault with faultType, and
          urType with anyType.
        - Attributes now appear on an element itself instead of the element's
          parent. For elements parsed to builtin python types, the attributes are
          stored in a dictionary keyed by the element's python id. The dictionary
          is in the Context object, can be returned from parseSOAP*, and can be
          returned from method calls if the returnAllAttrs configuration option
          is set.
        - isinstance is used to check for a class, so classes can be subtyped.
        - An encoding of None can be specified to not include encoding information.
        - Problems with the SOAPProxy URL are now reported when the SOAPProxy
          instance is created instead of when the first method call is made.
        - The Binary, Boolean and DateTime types have been removed in favor of
          binaryType, booleanType, and dateTimeType.
        
        
        VERSION 0.9.5 (5/16/01)
        -----------------------
        
        - Should parse and build all 1999, 2000, 2001, and SOAP-ENC datatypes.
        - Initial handling of multi-dimensional, partial, and sparse arrays.
        - Supports SSL clients (if Python built with OpenSSL).
        - Supports SSL servers (if M2Crypto installed).
        - Applies defaults to SOAPproxy URLs (nice for command-line tools).
        - Added the _SOAPContext object, gives registered server functions more info
          about the current call.
        - Now assumes that any type that isn't in a schema could be a struct.
        - Added the Config object, now config options can be set globally or on an
          individual call level.
        - Deprecated the DateTime, Binary and Boolean types, should now
          use dateTimeType, binaryType and booleanType.
        - Includes N+I interop suite.
        - Various bug fixes and improvements.
        
        VERSION 0.9 (5/01/01)

        VERSION 0.8.5 (4/25/01)
        -----------------------
        
        - buildSOAP, SOAPProxy, SOAPServer now taking encoding argument
        - Much improved multi-referencing (Parser)
